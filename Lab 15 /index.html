			<h1>Lab 15: AJAX</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge
					<p>The challeneg of the current lab was to experiemnt with jQuery and AJAX but more
                        speciffically to do so by testing out an API endpoint and then to gather info. 
                        from an external soruce, through AJAX.</p>
                     </h2>

					<h3>Problems
					<p>The problems that I came across while testing out an API for the first time, while
                       using anjQuery AJAX call to retrieve output from the forutune cookie API msyelf and 
                       my project partner decided to utilize for the assignment, were adding the API's 
                       into our HTML correctly and the corresponding javascript code. For the corresponding
                       JavaScript code, we intially had a hard time programming our "Get Fortune" button to
                       generate responses that look/sound like real fortunes. Thus, after truble-shooting for 
                       a few hours, researching different methods in reference to using API's in HTML coding 
                       and what was then the correct Javascript code that matched our HTML code, and 
                       brainstorming together for another hour or so, we finally figured out a way to resolve
                       the issue and make the code work.</p>

					<h4>Results
                    <p>The results of this were completing a API test and using a variation of an jQuery .ajax 
                        recipe to create a sub-section on the bottom of my webpage, that within users are able    
                        to choose from one of four following categories, "General, "Love", "Career", "Health",
                        and recieve a personalized "fortune" in accordance to whichever category they selected.
