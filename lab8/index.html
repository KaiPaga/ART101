            <h1>Lab 8: Anon Function and Callbacks</h1>
			<h2><u> Challenges</u></h2>
				<p>The challenge of this lab was linking our Javascript file to the index.html file and correctly
                    learning how to use anonymous functions like that of callback with map to make our arrays 
                    reappear/fcntion correctly. 
				</p>
			      </div>

					<h2><u>Problems</u></h2>
					<p>The problems we ran into while completing lab 8 were accidentally adding spaces in our coding 
                        when we didn't need them there and in general, putting in the correct puntation.
				     </p>
			           </div>

                 
					<h2><u>Reflections</u></h2>
					<p>From completing this assignment, we were able to learn more about Javascript, how anonynmous functions 
                        and the console in Javascript work and practice our trouble-shooting skills.
					 </p>
			 </div>

		
					<h2><u>Results</u></h2>
					<p>The results are an re-editted, lab 8 homepage that includes the numbered 
                        array we creted in our javascript concoles.
