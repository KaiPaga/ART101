            <h1>Lab 7: Functions</h1>
			<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>For this lab, myself and my teammate intially struggled with creating a new ;ab 7 folder and linking the Javasript file into our
                    HTML files.

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>After figuring that out we were able to continue on with the assignment.

			           </div>

                 
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>After completing this assignment, we were both able to learn more about Javascript, sorted lists, and how to link such into 
                        our webpages.
					 </p>
			 </div>

		
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>The results were a homepage like such.
