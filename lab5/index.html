		<h1>Lab 5: Data Types and Variables</h1>
			
		 <p>For lab 5, I partnered up with fellow UCSC and ART101 student Caroline, 
		 entered variables into a <p>Javascript Console, declared all of those 
		 variables into a Javascript file, used various elements like </p> that  
		 of heading, div, and paragraph tags to decorate my homepage and 
		 lastly linked my Javascript file <p>that was from my HTML into a div.
		 </p>

			
		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		 <p>Intially, when I first attempted to add/link the photo of a Santa Cruz 
		  metro Bus onto my lab 5 homepage <p> the link didn't work because I accidentially 
		  uploaded it to the wrong img folder. Thus, after realizing </p> my mistake I moved the photo
		  of the Santa Cruz Bus to the correct file and was able to continue on <p> with the 
		  rest of the assignnment.
	      </p>
		    </div> 


           
	
			   <h2>Results</h2>
			   <p>From following the directions of and completing lab 5, myself and my 
			   partner were able to create index.html <p>files of homepages dedicated to 
			   the seprarte forms of transportation that we use to get around while 
			   studying </p> here in Santa Cruz. We were able to add an image to this 
			   homepage, provide breif descriptions of what our <p>chosen forms of 
			   transportation look like and style those pages accordingly.
