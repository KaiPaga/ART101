					 <p>Hi and welcome new users to the story of previous long distance runner and 
						current udnergraduate student, Kai Pagan. Orginally born on the island of Oahu and 
						raised their until the age of 15, Kai spent a majority of his early teen years and 
						childhood barbecuing on sandy beaches and eating spam musbis from local seven elevns 
						for lunch. Kai also did a little bit of horse back riding, as he used to take beginneer 
						lessons, in the sport and while I never liked institutionalized basketball loved to play the 
						street verison of it with friends.</p> 
						
						<p>After moving to the East Bay of California, Kai finished 
						highschool at at Newark Memorial Highschool, where for his last year, joined his school
						 cross country and track and field team. While, Kai never placed first in any of his races, 
						 the socail connections he made and atheletic preservance that he would eventually come to 
						 show were more than enough for him.</p> 
						 
						 </p>Kai attended Ohlone communitty college, received an 
						 associates degree in Sociology, decided to take 2 years off from school to travel and solely focus on work for a bit, and 
						 then transferred over to the Unveristy of California, Santa Cruz. Kai is a third-year, sociology major, 
						 with a concentration in Global Information and Social Enterprise Studies.</p>
