                <p>The challenges that we faced duirng this lab included "grabbing" our fucntions from the pevious lab that we did where we
                    created a sorted string, adding event listeners to our buttons, and adding inputs speceifically to our form fields, as we 
                    intially understand what the term form fields meant, within coding/programming.</p>

                   <h2>Problem</h2>
                    <p>The problems that we stumbled upon were correctly inputting the text fields and the button id, "Submit."</p>

                    <h2>Results</h2>
                    <p>The finished product is an new homepage that has an output section and a button on the bottom that's labeled 
                        submit and programming that button so that everytime it's clciked on, it completes the function of rearranging 
                        the letters, witin my name.</p>
