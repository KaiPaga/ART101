             <h2>Challenges</h2>
			 <p>For this lab, we were tasked with creating an input form field, a new button 
             for submitting, a new output div, a "funtional sortingHat" in our Javascript 
             files and conditionals that return the four different Harry Potter houses of 
             Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Slytherin, and Hufflepuff, which will also depend on 
             the value of different mods (starting from 0 to 3).</p>
             <h2>Problem</h2>
			 <p>For lab 12, as both myself and my partnr have never utilzised mods and 
             conditionals while coding, we ran into mutiple problems along the way of 
             executing and completing our verisons of lab 12. One of the main problems 
             we were able to eventuallly tangle and solve was that of creating a "click 
             listener" and attaching that to our #button. To do such, we spent some time 
             trouble-shooting, researching atlernative methods/ways of completing the task
             via Google, and comparing/contrasting our own work to the examples that were 
             screenshooted in the lab assignment, itself. Secondly, a problem that I 
             personally ran into was aliging the text of my "JavaScript source" link to be 
             located at the bottom right of my wbpage, without also moving my "Back home" 
             link along with it and being able to keep that link separately aligned on 
             the left side, of my webpage. </p>
             <h2>Results</h2>
			 <p>The results are a re-designed webpage for lab 12, with a new section added to 
             the bottom that allows users to enter their full names and see which Harry 
             Potter themed, house they would hypothetically be sorted into to. Additionally, 
             I also decided to add an image that I was able to find online and that followed the 
             overall Harry Potter theme of the webpage. This image is located at the top right 
             of my webpgae and has decorative symbols for each house.</p>
