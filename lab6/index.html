			<h1>Lab 6:Arrays and Objects</h1>
			<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>Some of the challenegs we had to overcome during lab 6 mostly involved
			     corectly linking the javascript files into our HTML's, formatting our  
				 homepage's to look visually appealing and aligning the text/image of 
				 our homepage's. 
				</p>
			      </div>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Some problems that arose while completing lab 6, included using semicolons 
					   when I should have been using commas instead and not uploading the photo of 
					   the Santa Cruz Metro Bus, that's located in the upper right corner of my 
					   webpage correctly, as I orginally still tried to use the last photo of a 
					   bus that I had already uploaded to the img folder that was udnerneath lab 5.
				     </p>
			           </div>

                 
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>The assignment lab 6 was very helpful in terms of providing us with an 
						opporunity to practice our Javascript skills more indepthly and learn how 
					    to not only create arrays but also how to reference multiple items, from 
					    those arrays and succesfully link the lists/arrays we had in our Javascript 
						Console's to appear on our homepages.
					 </p>
			 </div>

		
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>The results of lab 6 consist of a well-detailed and recently updated webpage
					   that's main topic are the various forms of transportation that I utilzise to 
					   get around while residing in Santa Cruz, as being an individual who choses to
					   not drive or have a driver's license. Through editting the index html file and 
					   the CSS stylesheet, I was able to change the color, adjust the size, width, and 
					   placement of my webpage's, image and choose the particular font I wanted.
