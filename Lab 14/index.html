					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenges of this lab included revising older labs that we had previosuly 
						submitted for past assignemtns that were due earlier in the quarter and then 
					    correcting the mistakes and/or errors that we intially made hwne completing 
					    those labs. </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>As for the problems that arose myself and my partner decided to complete this 
						remotely and becuase of such revised and reviewed different previous 
					    assignments. Thus, the problems that arose duirng this lab were different 
					    for the both of us but personally, I struggled with simply correcting my
					    previous mistakes. Additionally, during the lab, my personal device that I 
					    was completing it on, kept losing internet connection for the last two hours 
					    that I was finishing it. </p>
